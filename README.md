ASP.NET Core is an open-source and cross-platform framework for building modern cloud-based internet-connected applications, such as web apps, IoT apps, and mobile backends. ASP.NET Core apps run on [.NET](https://dot.net), a free, cross-platform, and open-source application runtime. It was architected to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. It consists of modular components with minimal overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your solutions. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on Windows, Mac, and Linux. [Learn more about ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/).
